    "In this class, you will do most of your programming in the [Python](http://python.org) language. It is great for rapid prototyping, yet robust enough for industrial use -- in fact, Python is also one of the 3 main languages in use at Google!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Can you name the other two?\n",
    "\n",
    "It also has extensive library support, meaning a lot of the code you will need day-to-day already exists -- you just need to find it, download it (if necessary), and start using it in your own programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to impress your computer science friends at a cocktail party, then try to remember that Python\n",
    "* is _interpreted_, rather than compiled;\n",
    "* is _dynamically typed_, rather than statically typed;\n",
    "* supports _automatic garbage collection_, rather than manual memory allocation;\n",
    "* has _functional_ programming constructs, in addition to imperative programming.\n",

    "It's probably obvious that one of your main goals is to write _correct_ programs. But another important goal, especially if you want to scale to large data sets, is _efficiency_.\n",
